# Mowgli-Seq-Problem

This is a project aimed to help <a href="">Mowgli</a> to automatically extract the title and the sequence from the file 'rawtext.txt'
and search for each of them in the webform at <a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins">this link</a>.
I plan to do this using Java and JavaScript. Java to extract the title and the sequence, Javascript to search them
in the web form.
